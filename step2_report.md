Step 2 of Mobile Application Development - Alarm++ team.

Current functional code in "AI-Alarm" branch on Git.

## Local data storage

Alarms set by the user are stored in a Proto Datastore database. An alarm is a simple data object
with a set time of day and weekdays and whether the alarm is enabled.

## Challenges and solutions

### Storing data

We're using Proto Datastore to profit from its simplicity.

### Managing time

The current implementation is AI-generated. We intend to use the generated code as an example to
build a cleanly coded app for the next iteration.
