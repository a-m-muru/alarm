## Build Process for APK

Create a keystore with Android Studio (or other tools). Then build the signed APK through android
studio. Gradle handles dependencies etc.

## Known Bugs or Limitations

* Alarms don't repeat weekly properly.
* Dark theme should be toggleable through settings (need to add settings).
* Alarm ideally would get quieter once you open the screen.
